This repository contains a selection of past and present projects from Jihyun Jeon.   

## 1. Rescue Mission

Rescue Mission is a game written in C. The game was developed as a final project of cs3 in 2022 Spring term with Philippe Des Boscs, Victor Gomez, and Riti Argrawal.    
A video of the gameplay can be accessed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZSODnn69s8     
The game was implemented using SDL2 and emscripten.   
The game features a hero that has to avoid obstacles (lasers, zappers and missiles). Coins lead to a higher score.    
Special powerups (invincibility and coin magnet) can be used with the powerup coin.  

- Uses vector graphics   
- Uses a physics engine, including collision detection, drag, spring, and gravity    
- Highscore tracking 

## 2. Autonomous Navigation

The programs control a robot with two motors, 3 IR sensors and 3 Ultrasound sensors. The robot is able to follow a black line on a white background, autonomously explore a map, and find and traverse the shortest path between two coordinates with Dijkstra's Algorithm while avoiding streets blocked with obstacles. The robot takes inputs from the user to trigger its actions, including explore, pause, goal, save, clear and has a stepping mode mainly used for debugging. This project is currently in progress. The programs are implemented for projects of ME/CS/EE129 in 2023 Spring term with Emily Baylock and Catherine Zheng.

## 3. Data Structures

The data structures were implemented in Java. They were written as projects of cs2 in 2022 Winter term.   
The data structures include graph, dictionarys (chaining hash and move to front), deques (linked, array), heap and maps    

## 4. Sort

Various sorting algorithms were implemented in Java. They were written as a project for AP Computer Science in 2018.     
The sorting algorthms implemented include heap, insertion, quick, and selection sort. 

## 5. Matrix    

The matrix was implemented in Java. It was created as a project for AP Computer Science in 2018.     
Various matrix calculations were implemented, including Gaussian elimination and back substitution.     

## 6. Heart Simulation    

A simulation for hearts implemented in Python. The simulation was written for a project in AP Statistics in 2019.   
The simulation was created to test various factors and their influence on winning a game in Hearts.    
The base for the simulation was implemented by David Corin, found in https://github.com/danielcorin/Hearts.
